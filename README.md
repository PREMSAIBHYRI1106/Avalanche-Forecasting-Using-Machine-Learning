# Avalanche-Forecasting-Using-Machine-Learning

-This Project is based on Building a Machine Learning for Prediction of Avalanches


The model is Built considering the following factors
  -Slope Angle
  -Forest Density
  -Air Temprature
  -Wind Speed
  -Snow Density
  
 The model Predicts and Categorises the risk of Avalanches as
  -Low risk
  -High risk
  -Moderate risk
